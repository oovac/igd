\noindent\textbf{IGD perspective and separation of ontology from models.}
Information--Geometric Dynamics (IGD) is built around a clean split
between \emph{ontological} statements about the world---facts about
distinguishable states, information, resources and constraints—and
the \emph{epistemic} structures we use to describe it: coordinates,
effective models, ``observers'' and focus manifolds. The axioms live
on this ontological layer; individual theory notes, such as the present
one, correspond to particular choices of focus manifold and coordinate
system on top of that layer. In this way IGD turns questions about
physics into questions about information and geometry, while keeping
the distinction between facts and their descriptions explicit.
